1-## Backpropagation from scratch

  Currently, there are many deep learning frameworks that are used to deal with the complexity of gradient calculations
  We know that before it was very difficult to train neural networks, but today we have many techniques that we can use to have a more efficient training
  Even though we have several techniques and several frameworks available to train neural networks, it is always important to have a sense of what happens behind the frameworks, this 
 ensures that we have full control of what we are actually doing .
