## 1- Backpropagation from scratch

  Currently, there are many deep learning frameworks that are used to deal with the complexity of gradient calculations
  We know that before it was very difficult to train neural networks, but today we have many techniques that we can use to have a more efficient training
  Even though we have several techniques and several frameworks available to train neural networks, it is always important to have a sense of what happens behind the frameworks, this 
 ensures that we have full control of what we are actually doing .

 1.1 - The main idea of this project is to show how we can correctly perform backpropagation without any framework, which is really complicated and difficult. In the real world, this is 
      not typically done, but when we learn and understand how things work under the hood, everything becomes much clearer.
